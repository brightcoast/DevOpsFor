# What is DevOps

> DevOps (a clipped compound of "software DEVelopment" and "information technology OPerationS") is a term used to refer to a set of practices that emphasize the collaboration and communication of both software developers and information technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.[1][2] It aims at establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and releasing software can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably.
