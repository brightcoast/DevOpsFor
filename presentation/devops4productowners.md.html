# What is DevOps?

--

DevOps (a clipped compound of "software DEVelopment" and "information technology OPerationS") is a term used to refer to a set of practices that emphasize the collaboration and communication of both software developers and information technology (IT) professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes. It aims at establishing a culture and environment where building, testing, and releasing software can happen rapidly, frequently, and more reliably.*

.footnote[.red.bold[*] Wikipedia]

Well, that doesn't help...

???
Unfortunately - not a straight forward "product"/"thing"
* Cultural component - getting communications and shared goals
* Automation and tools

So lets hold off on "What is it" and go to...

---

# Why is DevOps?
### Roots - merging Developers and Operations work

* Developers - make the code
   * User Interface (UI/UX)
   * Business Logic/Rules
   * Integrations
   * Database (usually)
       
* Ops - runs the code
   * Servers
   * Networks
   * Databases

.left-column[

## Examples
* .NET + front end + database
* Java + front end + database
* MEAN (Mongo Express Angular Node)
* Django (Python + front end + database


* Front End: Bootstrap, React, Backbone, Angular, etc.
* Database: Postgres, SQL Server, Oracle, Mongo

## Ops View

* Networking zones
* URLs - _https://myapp.gov.bc.ca_
* Authentication - siteminder
* Encryption - SSL
* Firewalls
* Servers
* Storage

* Implementation: _Takes too long_
   * Devs: Code Development
   * Ops: Acquisition/Configuration of Servers

Expected

* Devs - 100% of functionality, end user requirements, changes
* Ops - 100 other apps to manage, production issues

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...so does *_The Wall of Confusion_*

.center[<img src="images/overthewall.png" alt="Over the Wall of Confusion" height="350" >]

---

# What goes wrong?
###Inconsistent Environments

* Developers build in their world, deliver to a different one
   * Each Dev creates their own development/test capability - best efforts
      * Execution environment doesn't match reality, either does test data
   * Periodically delivers code - usually at a milestone - e.g. UAT
      * Agile methodology SHOULD address this
   * Test data doesn't match production
      * _Non-Functional Requirements_

--

###Impact:

* It works on my machine!
   
???

* Performance must be acceptable
   * But volume of data not considered
   * Options:
      * Get the data
      * Other mitigation strategies

---

# What goes wrong?
###Ineffective Communications

* Communication is via Word documents - the dreaded _Release Guide_
   * Premise: To deploy this app, do this...
   * Assumption: The writer knows the readers world...impossible

--

###Impact:

* Steps are performed manually
* On-the-fly adjustments are made...further invalidating the assumption
  * On Dev, Test and Prod

???

Example - doing home PC support - remotely

---

# What goes wrong?
###Unnecessary Dependencies

* The _iStore_ optimization
   * iStores/funding force optimizations on time and cost
   * Method: Few servers, shared resources

--

###Impact:

* Unwanted dependencies between apps
 * Coordination of multple apps because of shared dependencies
 * Outages of an app because of an upgrade to another
* The Release Party
   
---

# All of which leads to...


--
# The Day After

.center[<img src="images/dayafter.jpg" alt="The Day After" width="75%" >]

???

* Users can't log in
* Performance is terrible
* A feature no longer works
* Bugs occur
* Non-Functional Requirements
    * Performance
    * Monitoring
    * Logging
    * Capacity
---

# The Reflex Response

* We are doing it right, we just need to do it *better* next time

* Test more - take longer, check _EVERYTHING_

--

* Except - the users still want more fixes/capabilities

.left-column[

* Each application is a project - an event
   * Not a product with a lifecycle
   * Focus is on the application, not long term
   
* Contracted teams
   * Each starts with own approach & tools
   * Highly variable contact with Ops
   * Improvements are local (team) not system-wide
   
* Limited access to data
  * Production type data
  * Production volumes of data

# So...What is DevOps?

The application of Lean principles to the end to end systems:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_Maximize value; minimize waste_

<img src="images/leanprocess.png" alt="Lean Process - Continuous Improvement" width="55%" >

--

...using some really powerful tools

The shoulders of giants - continuously

# Analogous to Agile

And to some extent driven by agile...

# Problem: The Release Guide

* Old: Write It in Word - every step
    * Compile Code
    * Build Code - for each component
    * Test the Build
    * Install pre-requisites
    * Install code
    * Restart components
    * Verify components

--
    
* Better: Write it as a repeatable script
   * Not easy - done incrementally - by lazy programmers
   * ...in isolation

--
   
* Even Better: Create tools to improve each step

???

Example - ICM - 24-48 hours of orchestrated activities - 10 people in a room
Common - developers best effort 
---

# Solution: The Deployment Pipeline
<img src="images/continuous-deployment-pipeline.png" alt="Deployment Pipeline" width="80%" >

--

* Subversion, git, github - manage code
* Maven, grunt - build tools
* xUnit - unit test tools
* Selenium, Jmeter - integration test tools
* Migrations, Datical, E-F - database upgrades
* Jenkins - Continuous Integration, job runner

--


* Connected via triggers

---

# So Many Tools...

# Problem: The Day After

--

### Solution: Release Early and Often - "_Shift Left_"

<img src="images/Agile_DevOps_Shift_Left_Testing.jpg" alt="Shift Left - Agile and DevOps" width="60%" >

???

The first production deploy should NEVER be the day before go live!!!

???

Continuous Integration
Non-functional requirements - real data in real production - controlled

Risk Mitigation

# Problem: The Day After

### Solution: Really Fast Releases

--

.right-column[<img src="images/lessthan30minutes.png" alt="Less than 30 minute releases" width="65%" >]

.left-column[

Done _properly_ - aka "Roll-forward"

1. Issue found
2. Issue documented - e.g. JIRA entered
3. Issue investigated
4. Issue fixed, checked in
5. Build / Deploy
6. Verify fix
7. Deploy to Test
8. Verify
9. Deploy To Production...phewwww!!!

]

???

Traditional approach - 1, 3, and fix in production

# Problem: Change is Bad

--

#####Big Release - Big Risk - many things to break - hard to fix
#####Small Release - Small Risk - only a few things to break - easy to fix

???

This applies to Dev, Test and Prod

---

# Problem: Works on my System!

--

### Solution: Consistent Environments

.right-column[<img src="images/Pets-Cattle-2.png" alt="Pets vs. Cattle" width="100%" >]

.left-column[]

#####Tools to enable consistency

* Ansible, Puppet, Chef - server setup tools
* Subversion, git, github - configuration as code

--

#####Tools so Dev = Production

* Vagrant - VMs
* Docker - Containers

NOTE: Open source licensing _REALLY_ helps.

???

Home PC vs. work PC analogy
Home PC you buy and own for years
Work PC you get, use, break and replace
In fact - there is a good argument to make home PCs the same

---

# Problem: Unnecessary Dependencies

--

### Solution: Stop it!!

--

.right-column[<img src="images/DecoupledReleases.png" alt="Decoupled Releases" width="100%" >]
.left-column[]

--

Fake Dependencies

* Enterprise Release Scheduling - don't!!
* Eliminate artificial deadlines

--

Architectural Dependencies

* Isolate apps / parts of apps
   * Different servers ($$$)
   * Docker, etc.
* Don't share databases
   * But don't duplicate data
   * Use APIs

---

# So...what is DevOps?

* A culture of continuous improvement as it relates to the _end to end_ delivery of systems
* ...supported by a growing (and standardizing) set of automation tools

--

.right-column[<img src="images/The-Phoenix-Project.jpg" alt="Decoupled Releases" width="80%" >]
.left-column[]

--

### The Three Ways
* Systems Thinking
   * Focus on impacts to the _entire_ system
* Create Feedback Loops
   * Verify your assumptions/theories
* Continual Experimentation and Learning

---

# Are we doing DevOps??

.left-column[

### Anti-Patterns

* No version control
* No discussion of Dev environments
* Cross Project Release Schedules
* Text-based Release Guide
* Post-deployment Fixes without Releases
* Multi-app Release Party Email Chains
* Server Names - pets (vs. _Services_)
* Test Date = Start UAT Date - 1 Day
* Go to Test, go to Production dates
* Production Date = Go Live Date - 1 Day


* Day After syndrome - it hurts!

]

--

.right-column[

### Patterns

* Version Control for everything
* Devs world ~= Production
* Many, many, many deployments
   * Support for Agile Methodology
   * Automatic deployment to Dev
   * Triggered deployment to Test, Prod
   * No manual steps - _database_
* Early deployments to test, prod
* Automated tests
* Automatic feedback and notifications
* App deployments are independent
* Business drives production releases


* Day After is just like the Day Before
